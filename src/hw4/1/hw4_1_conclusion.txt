Since there are only 20 steps associated with the for loop, setting the chunk size
to 50 results in the same execution time as the serial execution in both the
static chunk size 50 and dynamic chunk size 50 scenarios.

It is seen that the amount of time taken to complete the work increases towards the end
of the for loop. Therefore, work should be allocated to more threads from the end of
the execution. That happens both in dynamic default (default is usually 1) and guided 
execution. Therefore dynamic default and guded execution has the lowest of execution times.

Out of those 2, I got mixed results at different times (dynamic was lower in most cases), because 
same sort of allocation happens towards the end, but we could argue that guided will be better 
than dynamic default if we extend the array to have like 100 steps, because of the lower 
scheduling costs compared to dynamic.
