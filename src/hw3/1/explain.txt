4a) Although tid is declared in the serial region, private(tid) 
clause in the omp parallel causes tid to be made thread local having 
copies of tid for each thread. Therefore, address of each tid is Different
from one thread to another.

4b) tid is defined inside the omp parallel block. Therefore, tid is inherantly
thread local. Therefore, tid address of each thread is different.

4c) in the 3rd example, tid is declared in the serial region. It was
not declared as private in the omp parallel clause. Therefore, tid is not 
thread private. So all the threads access the same tid declared in the serial region.
All the threads write to the same tid address. Therefore, the last value contained
in tid is from the last thread executed. This value is not deterministic because
it depends on the last thread that was executed. 
Also note that same tid is printed by multiple threads now.
